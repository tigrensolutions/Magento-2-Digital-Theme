Although it's not difficult to find a digital and electronics Magento 2 theme on the market, both premium and free for download, getting a high-quality one would be immensely challenging.

<em>But now you find it!</em>

B.Geek is one of the best Magento 2 themes for digital stores, not only owing to its attractive, innovative, and responsive design, but also due to its high-quality and clean code following high Magento standards.

<h2>HIGHLIGHTS OF B.GEEK MAGENTO 2 DIGITAL THEME</h2>

Tigren's designer and developer team put a considerable effort to create an excellent Magento 2 digital and electronics theme. Let's discover some noticeable features of this template:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Modern Digital Shop Design:</strong> While most of the Magento 2 themes for digital stores look boring and follow some old-fashioned styles, B.Geek finds a separate way. As you can see, the whole design is imbued with elegant but trendy signature colors of technology, innovation, and creativity without bombastic details. It has a line-based layout, an impressive big banner slider on the header, some custom slides that you can use for different purposes, and several blocks with a products focus. Also, the header features a fixed menu and quick access to the site search, my account, my wishlist, shopping cart, language, and currency exchange.</li>
 	<li><strong>Banner Slider:</strong> On this Magento 2 digital theme's homepage, the banner slider is functioned by Tigren's Magento 2 Banner Manager module. Thanks to that, the store owners can easily update and change their banner images directly on the back-end without "touching" the code.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
 	<li><strong>Featured Products/ New Arrivals:</strong> Since this Magento 2 responsive theme is product-driven, there are a variety of blocks on the homepage to draw shoppers' attention to popular items. Another interesting thing is that these blocks classify the products by categories, and the customers can easily change tabs to see "the best" in each category.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
 	<li><strong>Today Deals:</strong> Creating an attractive deal is no doubt one of the most effective ways to boost sales for Magento e-commerce stores. That's why we allocated a large space for "Today Deal" on this free Magento 2.3 theme. Moreover, the time countdown will play an essential role in stimulating purchases.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
 	<li><strong>New Products/ Best Seller/ Hot Sale:</strong> While the Featured Products and New Arrivals blocks are arranged according to categories, the New Products, Best Seller, and Hot Sale display outstanding items regardless of the categories. Owing to that, the buyers can quickly know which products are the most favorites throughout the store without browsing every catalog.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
 	<li><strong>Brand Slider:</strong> A large number of the Magento 2 stores are selling products from multiple brands. Hence, it's necessary to list all brand names right on the homepage so that the customers can understand more about the origins of your items and available brand options on your store.</li>
 	<li><strong>List &amp; Grid Category View:</strong> On the category page, the store visitors can select between the list and grid (more recommended) category view. On the grid mode, all of your products will be arranged in different rectangle boxes, following the decisive style throughout this free Magento 2 digital theme.</li>
</ul>
